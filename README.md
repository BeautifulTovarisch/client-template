### What is this repository for? ###

A quick-start webpack template that includes a dev-server, react + babel and redux pre-install. 
It also comes with environment-specific webpack build for convenience. 

### How do I get set up? ###

Simply run `yarn` or `yarn install`
to install the dependecies.

After that's done, running `yarn run dev-server` will start the webpack-dev-server with hot-reloading enabled. 

### Reminder ###

Be sure to change the directory name as well as set up the correct remotes.
Don't forget to change the name in the package.json!
